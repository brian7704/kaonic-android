kaonicCommunicationHandler.setEventListener(this)
```
* Get secret key 
```
kaonicCommunicationHandler.generateSecret()
```
* Start communication with selected protocol
    * For TCPIP communication - run this command from reticulum-rs directory: ````cargo run --example tcp-server````
    ```
    kaonicCommunicationHandler.start(
                secretKey,
               ConnectionConfig(
                   ConnectionContact(MY_NAME), arrayListOf(
                    Connection(
